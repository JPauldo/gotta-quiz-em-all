# Gotta Quiz 'Em All
Gotta Quiz 'Em All is a site designed to provide quizzes around fun trivia on topics such as coding and gaming. It will time the player through through the quiz and provide them a score based on how fast they were able to complete it. The questions are randomized for each playthrough to increase replayability. Upon score submission, the player is tajen to the High Score page. Here they can either reflect on their past score(s) or use as motivation to score better next time. They can also clear all scores, if desired. 

This project was a chance to create a fun little application that helped me to become more comfortable with Javascript. Setting intervals as well as storing data into local storage were just some of the techniques I used to create this project.
